We have recently released a Docker container for running JasDB. This should make it extremely simple for everyone to get their JasDB installation up and running.

## Docker commands
In order to get your docker container with JasDB up and running make sure you have a system with docker installed.

In order to run a simple JasDB container simply run the following:
```
docker run -d -p 7050:7050 renarj/jasdb:1.1.2
```

This however uses a default volume, we highly recommend storing the JasDB on a safe secured volume. Here is an example how to bind it to a host available path:
```
docker run -v /Users/devuser/dev/docker/volumes/jasdb-data:/jasdb-data -p 7050:7050 renarj/jasdb:1.1.2
```

We highly recommend checking the Docker documentation on volume management. The volume inside the JasDB container is always mapped on '/jasdb-data'.

## Docker hub
We have made the container available on docker hub here:
[Docker Hub JasDB](https://hub.docker.com/r/renarj/jasdb/)
